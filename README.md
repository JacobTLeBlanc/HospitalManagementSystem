- Add new patient
- Add new drug

### 2.4. Operating Environment
The operating environment for the new hospital management system is as listed below. 
- client/server system
- Operating System: Windows
- Database: mySQL database
- Platform: Spring application/Java

## 3.0. System Features and Requirements
The following is a description of the features for the new hospital management system.

### 3.4. Nonfunctional Requirements
  #### 3.4.1. Performance Requirements
  - ER Model
  - Normalization of a database

  #### 3.4.2. Safety Requirements
  In the case of failure, a recovery system will restore a past copy of the database to restore as much as possible.
